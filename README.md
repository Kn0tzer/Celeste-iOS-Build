## Legal
Files contained in download links are not hosted on GitHub. This build is for <b>Education Purposes Only!! I'm not saying that as a legal cop-out, I know that means nothing.</b> What I mean is that this build is borderline unusable on purpose, and shouldn't be used for playing the actual game. I've purposefully uploaded a version where the game itself runs in a tiny window intead of taking up the fullscreen, and the virtual controller occupies the majority of the screen, covering important things while not transparent. It is almost impossible to move and climb at the same time, making it very, very difficult to pass even the tutorial.

I've tried to make it as easy possible for you to ask me to take this down to avoid any legal issues. Because the download was not uploaded by me I can't delete it, but I can delete this repo.
